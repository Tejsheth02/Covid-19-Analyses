3 different datasets are present in the notebook.
First is covid-19 infection dataset on different countries.
Second is different happiness index parameters troughout the world.
Third is the total number od deaths due to covid-19 in the different countries.
Using python different operations(such as inner join, drop, groupby) were performed on the datasets to clean and filter out the data.
Visualising using seaborn revealed that countries that were less developed were less prone to the infection rates than the developed countries.
Also as infection rates increased the number of deaths also increased exponentially.
